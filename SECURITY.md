## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please do not report it via GitHub issues. Instead, email [security@tempo.xyz](mailto:security@tempo.xyz) and we will acknowledge your report within 5 days and provide a more detailed follow-up within 10 days.

Note: The Tempo blockchain is still undergoing audit and does not have an active bug bounty. Submissions will not be eligible for a bounty until audits have concluded
