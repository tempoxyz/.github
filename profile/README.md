[Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/) is a blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin payments built with the [Reth SDK](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth). Its architecture focuses on high throughput, low cost, and features that financial institutions, payment service providers, and fintech platforms expect from modern payment infrastructure.

What makes Tempo different?
- **TempoTransaction:** Tempo includes a new EIP-2718 transaction type (0x76), providing features like passkey authentication, call batching, scheduled and parallel transactions, and fee sponsorship built natively into the protocol.
- **TIP-20 token standard:** Enshrined stablecoin token standard optimized for payments and reconciliation.  
- **Payment lanes:** Tempo ensures that payment transactions always have available blockspace, even during periods of high network congestion from DeFi activity. 
- **Built with the Reth SDK:** High-performance, modular EVM execution layer under the hood powered by [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth).  
- **Simplex consensus:** Optimized for low-latency, low-overhead finality under normal conditions.  
- Fully [EVM-compatible](https://docs.tempo.xyz/quickstart/evm-compatibility).
