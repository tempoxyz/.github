[Tempo](https://tempo.xyz) is a payments-first blockchain incubated by [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz).

As stablecoins go mainstream, there’s a need for optimized infrastructure. Tempo is purpose-built for stablecoins and real-world payments, born from Stripe’s experience in global payments and Paradigm’s expertise in crypto.

Tempo’s payments-first design:
- Predictable low fees
- Opt-in privacy
- Payments/gas in any stablecoin via enshrined AMM
- Payments-first UX (dedicated payments lane, memos, access lists, etc)
- Scale (100K+ TPS, sub-second finality)
- EVM-compatible, built on [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth)

We’re partnering with builders across fintech, banking, ecommerce, agentic finance, and more — if you’d like to build with us, get in touch at partners@tempo.xyz
